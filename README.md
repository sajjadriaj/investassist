Built with an **agentic architecture** using CrewAI, it leverages the collaborative power of specialized AI agents to deliver real-time, actionable intelligence.

3.  **Deep Dive Analysis:** The selected agent(s) spring into action, utilizing their specific tools and expertise to gather and process relevant financial data. You'll see real-time status updates as they work!
4.  **Actionable Insights:** Using advanced AI, the agent(s) synthesize their findings into clear, human-readable, and actionable insights tailored to user query.
